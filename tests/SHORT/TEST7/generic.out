***** PROGRAM  =  THE MAGIC BLACK BOX *****
NPT Gibbs ensemble
Using periodic boundaries in x y z
3-dimensional periodic box
Particle coordinates are folded into central box
Additional center-of-mass cutoff on computed rcmu
CBMC simultaneously grows all beads conected to the same bead
   with bond lengths/angles generated from Gaussian distribution
Program will call explct() for explicit-hydrogen models
Dual Cutoff Configurational-bias Monte Carlo
Coulombic interactions will be included in the Rosenbluth weights for CBMC growth
Coulombic inter- and intra-molecular interactions will be calculated
   using Ewald-sum techniques
Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules apply
