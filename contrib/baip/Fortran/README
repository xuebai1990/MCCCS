The main driver is analysis.F90, which calls global.F90 to read the movie file, reads control parameters from analysis.cfg (the sample input is for water), and calls hbond.F90 and/or rdf.F90 to perform relevant analysis.

Compile the program with "gfortran -ffree-line-length-none -O3 -o analysis.exe global.F90 hbond.F90 rdf.F90 analysis.F90" (if the movie file to be analyzed was generated in the old format, add "-DOLD_CODE" to the option strings).

To perform analysis, cd to the directory containing your output files, make a link to a production movie file you want to analyze (such as "ln -sf movie.prod1 fort.10"), make a link to the config file (such as "ln -sf /path/to/analysis.cfg ."), and run the analysis code (/path/to/analysis.exe).
------------------------------------------------------------
average.F90 is used to average results (of successive runs and/or independent simulations) generated using the analysis programs. Please see the top of the file for a brief description of its usage.
------------------------------------------------------------
The entire post-analysis process can be automated using shell scripts if the directory containing the simulation data is reasonably well organized, such as one like projectX/temperature1/pressure3/RUN5, etc., where RUN5 contains all production output for the 5th independent run.

Change directory to projectX and run procall.script, which will call analysis.script and average.script in each directory that contains RUNxx, and generate the final output in the RESULT directory.
